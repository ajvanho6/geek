Drupal 8 Bootstrap theme

Install dependencies using npm by running the following command in the root of your theme folder:

npm install then

simply run gulp it is the same as running the build and watch commands in succession.

Special tanks to @j-hannah and his starter theme kit.

Techologies used here: Gulp, PostCss, JS/jQuery, Css3, Html5

After you install npm you should load static page with design. scss/layout/layout.scss you can see sass structure.
